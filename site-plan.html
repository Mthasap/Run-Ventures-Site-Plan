         Introduction
        Welcome to Run Ventures, your ultimate destination for all things related to running races and events.
        Whether you're a seasoned marathon runner or just starting your fitness journey, our website aims to 
        provide you with valuable information and resources to enhance your running experience. With four main
        headings on our navigation bar - Home, Races, Results, and Contact Us - we have structured our website
        to cater to your specific needs. Let's dive into the details of what you can expect to find on our site.

        Engaging Activities on the Site
        There are various activities that visitors can engage in on our site. One of the primary activities is
        browsing through the Races section, where they can explore upcoming events, read race descriptions,
        and access registration links. Runners can also view and submit race results through the Results section,
        enabling them to track their progress and compare their performance with other participants. Moreover, our
        website offers interactive features such as community forums, where runners can connect with like-minded
        individuals, share experiences, and seek advice.

        Necessary Information for Action
        To complete any actions on our site, such as registering for a race or submitting race results, visitors
        will need to provide specific information. For race registration, runners will typically need to provide
        personal details, choose their preferred race category, and make the necessary payment. When submitting
        race results, participants will need to enter their race number, finish time, and potentially upload
        supporting evidence, such as a photo of their bib or a GPS tracking record. We ensure that the registration
        and result submission processes are user-friendly and straightforward.
